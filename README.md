## Contribute

If you or your company use Gutenberg Prototype or appreciate the work I’m doing in open source, please consider supporting me directly so I can continue maintaining it and keep evolving the project. It's pretty clear that software actually costs something, and even though it may be offered freely, somebody is paying the cost.

You'll be helping to ensure I can spend the time not just fixing bugs, releasing new versions, but also keeping the project afloat. Any contribution you make is a big help and is greatly appreciated.

Please also consider starring ✨ and sharing 👍 the repo! This helps the project getting known and grow with the community. 🙏
